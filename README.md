You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Auth

In order to use GraphQL, you would need a token in your localstorage.

You should be redirected to the login page if token is missing.

Just login with the account you previously created on the scopeapp.io.


## Deploy

When you feel done, deploy your work to the hosting of your preference.
